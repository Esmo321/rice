# RICE

My arch linux ricing.
Bspwm or DWM (i3 config files kept because why not)
Bspwm has better multimonitor support.
DWM is suckless, simple and effective, but i haven't messed with it enough to get nice multimonitor support.
ST
Polybar (Really looking for a new panel to make the change, haven't found it yet)
Sxhkd
mpd + ncmpcpp
bash (Maybe zsh in the future)

Using pywal for all the system colors. (should i change to gruvbox?)
